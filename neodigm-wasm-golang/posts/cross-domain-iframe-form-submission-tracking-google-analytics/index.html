<p>Providing a holistic executive CMO Dashboard is a common goal among digital marketing agencies. Giving clients <em>&ldquo;all digital at a glance&rdquo;</em> is a huge win because it returns objective business value immediately in the form of agile decision making.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;single source of the truth&rdquo; mantra means stakeholders have actionable high-fidelity insight into disparate digital ad platforms trends. A surprising number of agencies have trouble delivering just such a dashboard.</p>
<p>There are some popular third-party solutions that can provide most of this functionality at a <em>significant</em> price. Platforms such as Tableau have existing connections to the usual suspects; Facebook, Google, Twitter,¬†‚Ä¶ However you may still find yourself struggling to fully automate every desired data point. Unfortunately, you may still be cutting and pasting Bing Ads or LinkedIn Ads data.</p>
<p>This Machvive solution is scalable, future-proof, and cost effective. We don&rsquo;t mind getting our hands dirty if we can save money in the long run and have absolute control over our data. &ldquo;Save money&rdquo; is not just referring to the cost of third-party Platform as a Service (PaaS) licensing. Everyone is keenly aware of the opportunity cost of having a human manually paste data. It might work for two clients but five hundred, not so much.</p>
